		<p>To run this example, go to the examples/minimal directory and execute</p>
		<ol>
			<li>npm install</li>
			<li>gulp</li>
			<li>open build/index.html</li>
		</ol>
		<p>The first command will make sure a local install of gulp is available, the second will run gulp-neuter, and the third will open the generated page in your browser. If all went well, you should now get a popup from the combined script file!</p>
